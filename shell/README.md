This includes the collaborations of my lab currently:

the files are located in the folder "additionalHelp"


"FileNotFoundError" from p3-exec.py is an error not 
found in python 2.7 thus I required python 3 or above. 
The correction for "except FineNotFoundError:" in python 2.7 is 
"EnvironmentError as e:" and it works just fine now
